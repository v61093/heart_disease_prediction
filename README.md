# heart_disease_prediction
A healthcare organization together with a couple of government hospitals in a city has collected information about the vitals that would reveal if the person might have a coronary heart disease in the next ten years or not. This study is useful in early identification of disease and have medical intervention if necessary. This would help not only in improving the health conditions but also the economy as it has been identified that health performance and economic performance are interlinked. Given the data, we need to develop appropriate models to identify/predict if the person likely to have heart disease or not.
